  <img src="image/picture of me.jpg" alt="Shadrack Addison" width="50%">
  <p style="color: white"> Hello and welcome to my first page! It is a pleasure to have you here.</p>
  <h2 style="color: white">About me</h2>
  <p style="color: white">I was born and raised in Ghana, West Africa. I lived my childhood playing with my friends and going to school. I don't quite remember a lot from when I was a kid.
  I only remember spending time with my family and neighbours. We travelled a lot but the unexpected happened when we moved to a different continent.
  We moved to Italy when I was nine years-old. I was excited. And I knew my life was about to change.</p>
  <h3 style="color: white"> Here's a list of things I did when I arrived in Italy <h3/>
    <ol style="color: white">
      <li style="color: #F51201">ATTEND SCHOOL</li>
      <p> The first thing my parents made me do was register me to the nearest school. This was to help me learn the Italian language. I'm grateful for the decision they made. Children have
        the ability to easily learn things at a young age and me learning the Italian language to an adequate level in less than nine-months is proof of that. Now that I was able to interact
        with people, I had to partake in some of the activities they practiced. Football was a must. Being a Man United fan, my dream as a kid, back when I was young was to play alongside Cristian Ronaldo.
        So I applied to play football!</p>
      <li style="color: #EBE710">PLAY FOOTBALL</li>
      <p> I remember my first training session. It was very exhausting. I scored two goals during our end-of-training match. The sun was shinning bright, yet the cold could still be felt.
        Unforgettble afternoon. I played football for six consecutive years. In the role of a Left-Back, with various change in positions, we managed to get ourselves a couple of trophies. The most memorable
        one was the last one we won before my move to the UK. Here's a picture of me with one of my dearest teammates.</p>
        <img src="image/trophy image.jpg" alt="Image with teammate" width="50%">
      <li style="color: #04D439">PRACTICE VARIOUS SPORTS </li>
      <p> During my academic years in Italy, I was part of a class known as "Classe Sportiva". The English translation meant Sportive Class. It basically meant that, with our normal classes and studies, we got to
        experience various sports activities, such as:
        <ul>
        <li>horse riding, fencing, badmington;</li>
        <li>handball, volleyball, football; </li>
        <li>tennis, skiing, kayaking many more exciting ones..</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those three years spent doing all those activities helped develop me into the sportive person I am. I wish it could've lasted a little longer as I sometimes start to miss the good days.
          We lived a pretty peaceful life in Italy, but finding a working opportunity there was quite a hussle. Hence why my family decided to move one more time to a place where finding such opportunities weren't
          impossible. We also decided that, it was best to choose a country where we wouldn't have to learn a new language in order to be able to work. We decided that the United Kingdom was the "Promised Land". </p>
      <li style="color: #05A3F6">MOVE TO THE UNITED KINGDOM</li>
      <p> I arrived to the United Kingdom late 2017 and have since then been here, studying and working. I could not partake in any sportive activities as the time I had available was little to none. However I do cycle,
          and that has helped me keep the sportive and healthy physique I now have. Once I arrived in the UK, I did my GCSEs and went straight to do a Media Production course in College. I spent two years honing my media
        production skills. Here's a radio commercial I produced along with a TV advert.</p>
